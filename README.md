This is a program was written as an assignment for the Object Oriented Programming in Java course offered by UC San Diego through Coursera as the first course of 5 parts of __Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond Specialization__ where the skeleton to use Unfolding in Eclipse as well as some starter code had been provided.

### The purpose of this assignment is to visualize live earthquake data in a map. 
#### Specially in this prgoram I've done the followings:
1. Generate visual maps using Java code and the Unfolding Maps libraries, Processing library
1. Create and manipulate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
1. Read live earthquake data and visualize it on the map as well visualize cities around the world on the Map.



#### From this I course I've learnt the followings:
1. Data Structures: List, Map, 
1. Select and effectively use Java documentation
1. Create and draw memory models for reasoning about variable values for primitive and object data types
1. Use Java documentation in an effective manner
1. Use the Processing library in your programs
1. Use Java to read and parse data files
1. Java Interface, Abstract class, Inheritance, Polymorphism
1. Compiler Rules, Object creation in Java
1. Analyze event-driven code
1. Basic Sorting Algorithms:  Selection, Insert, Bubble, Merge, Quick. 
 

#### Work example:
Here is the final result of the project:
1. When the map is loaded with cities and earthqaukes: ![GitHub Logo](/img/loadedmapeithwuake.png)
